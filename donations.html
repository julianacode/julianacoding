	<p>While many civilizations require funds for goods and services, Dandelion has thrived off of the land for milenia. Therefore, those who wish to donate are instead encouraged to offer tributes to The Oasis</p>
	<br>
	<p>Tributes may come in the form of: Shrines, Food Offerings (fruit is preferred(PARTICULARLY STRAWBERRY ICECREAM)), sacrafice offerings (only during soltices please), and shiny jewlery. </p>
