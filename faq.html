	<p><b>Why Does Dandelion's Oasis Change Locations?</b></p>
	<p>This is a misconception - Dandelion's location does not change, it exists exactly where it's always existed, regardless of the desert that we enter it through.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Does Dandelion Have Legal Permission for The Oasis?</b></p>

	<p>Dandelion doesn't care about man-made borders and territories, and whether the act of moving location is intentional to assert this lack of care or if Dandelion doesn't care enough for it to be even moderately intentional is unknown. </p>
